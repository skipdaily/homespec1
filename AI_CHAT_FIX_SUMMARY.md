# HomeSpecTracker AI Chat Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the AI chat functionality in the HomeSpecTracker project that was showing "Failed to create new conversation" and "failed to fetch" errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration
- Cleaned up the `.env` file to remove duplicate entries
- Set development port to 4001 to avoid conflicts
- Added mock API keys for LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)

### 2. Database Connection
- Modified server/db.ts to handle database connection errors gracefully
- Added proper error handling and fallback to mock functionality

### 3. Storage Implementation
- Ensured that mock storage is used in development mode
- Fixed issues with the storage implementation

### 4. Server Configuration
- Updated server/index.ts to use the port from environment variables
- Added better logging for server startup

### 5. Helper Scripts
- Created a restart-server.sh script to easily restart the server
- Script kills any existing processes on port 4001 and starts the server

### 6. Documentation
- Created DEVELOPMENT_MODE.md with instructions for development
- Created PRODUCTION_SETUP.md with instructions for production deployment

## Testing Results
- Successfully created a conversation via API
- Successfully sent and received messages via API
- Server correctly runs in development mode with mock storage
- Mock AI responses are generated properly

## Next Steps for Production
1. Configure real Supabase DATABASE_URL
2. Set up actual LLM API keys
3. Run database migrations
4. Test with real data

## Usage Instructions
See DEVELOPMENT_MODE.md for detailed instructions on how to use the application in development mode.
