-- 1. Check if there are any triggers that might be interfering with the deletion process
SELECT 
    trigger_name,
    event_manipulation,
    action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE event_object_table IN ('rooms', 'items', 'item_history', 'images')
ORDER BY event_object_table;

-- 2. Try explicitly disabling triggers temporarily (if they exist)
-- ALTER TABLE item_history DISABLE TRIGGER ALL;
-- ALTER TABLE items DISABLE TRIGGER ALL;
-- ALTER TABLE rooms DISABLE TRIGGER ALL;

-- 3. Fix the potential constraint naming issue - if the constraint was renamed
-- but the error message still shows the old name
ALTER TABLE item_history DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS item_history_item_id_fkey;
ALTER TABLE item_history DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS fk_item_history_item;
ALTER TABLE item_history ADD CONSTRAINT fk_item_history_item 
    FOREIGN KEY (item_id) REFERENCES items(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- 4. Check for circular references
WITH RECURSIVE constraint_path(from_table, to_table, path, cycle) AS (
    SELECT 
        conrelid::regclass::text as from_table,
        confrelid::regclass::text as to_table,
        ARRAY[conrelid::regclass::text, confrelid::regclass::text] as path,
        false as cycle
    FROM pg_constraint
    WHERE contype = 'f'
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 
        cp.from_table,
        conf.confrelid::regclass::text as to_table,
        cp.path || conf.confrelid::regclass::text,
        conf.confrelid::regclass::text = ANY(cp.path) as cycle
    FROM constraint_path cp
    JOIN pg_constraint conf ON cp.to_table = conf.conrelid::regclass::text
    WHERE contype = 'f' AND NOT cycle
)
SELECT path FROM constraint_path WHERE cycle;

-- 5. Manual deletion approach (if all else fails)
-- BEGIN;
--   DELETE FROM item_history WHERE item_id IN (SELECT id FROM items WHERE room_id = [your_room_id]);
--   DELETE FROM images WHERE item_id IN (SELECT id FROM items WHERE room_id = [your_room_id]);
--   DELETE FROM items WHERE room_id = [your_room_id];
--   DELETE FROM rooms WHERE id = [your_room_id];
-- COMMIT;
